                <td>Mizi was the most outgoing participant and always carried a positive attitude. However, it has been noted that she finds it difficult to

                     going so far as to exploit Mizi's grief over Sua's death in order to undermine her performance during Round 5</td>

                <td>Till was the most timid among all the participants. This corroborates his depiction in round two, where he is shown to be incredibly docile.
                    However, despite this, it should be noted that he also has a vicious streak, 
                    which was particularly evident in the aforementioned second round where he sang over his opponent in order to win.</td>
